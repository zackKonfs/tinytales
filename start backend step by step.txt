npm init -y

npm i package-name → production dependency (needed when your app runs)

npm i -D package-name → dev dependency (only needed for development, testing, building, etc.)

What is CORS?
CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. It's a security mechanism that controls which websites can access your server.

Why you need it:
By default, if your frontend (running on localhost:3000) tries to request data from your backend (running on localhost:5000), the browser blocks it because they're on different ports/origins. CORS allows your backend to say "it's OK, I trust this frontend."

npm init -y
npm i express cors
npm i -D nodemon

change type to "module"



add below in jason:
"scripts": {
  "dev": "nodemon index.js",
  "start": "node index.js"
}

What each does:

npm run dev → Runs your app with nodemon, which auto-restarts when you change files. Use this while developing.
npm start → Runs your app normally with node. Use this when deploying to production.
Example workflow:

While coding: npm run dev → Edit a file → App auto-restarts instantly (you see changes right away)
When live: npm start → App runs once without restarts (no unnecessary reloads)
Why have both:

Development is iterative—you want auto-reload to see changes immediately
Production is stable—you don't want restarts eating resources or interrupting users
Convention:
npm start is a standard that hosting platforms recognize automatically. When you deploy to platforms like Heroku or Render, they look for and run npm start by default.


use for developer:
npm run dev
use for production:
npm start
